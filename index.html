        <p>
            TASBot is best described as a special R.O.B. robot outfitted with Legos to hold a custom circuit board that
            can exactly mimic the behavior of a video game controller. TASBot can play games on real video game
            consoles with superhuman abilities, usually leading to game breaking glitches in front of live audiences.
            TASBot has a long and storied history that starts with the initial efforts to replay Tool-Assisted
            Speedruns on physical hardware via a process now called console verification.

            TASBot was born on 2013-12-22 and is currently hosted by his creator and keeper, dwangoAC. He is on Twitter
            as @MrTASBot, TASBot.net (which redirects to this page), and on Freenode IRC in #tasbot. He has made
            appearances at AGDQ 2014, AGDQ 2015, SGDQ 2015, AGDQ 2016, SGDQ 2016, and AGDQ 2017 (although the earliest
            TAS involvement at a GDQ event was organized by DarkKobold during SGDQ 2011). TASBot has also participated
            in talks at TWiT's The New Screen Savers episode 60, DEF CON 24, and GeekPwn 2016.
